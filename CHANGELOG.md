## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Consolidated exit order entities (`StopLossOrder` and `TakeProfitOrder`) into a unified `ExitOrder` entity and `ExitOrders` table.
- Added `ExitOrderMode` enum (`TakeProfit`, `StopLoss`, `ManualExit`, `TimedExit`, `Algorithm`, `MarginCall`) with localized display attributes.

### Changed
- Updated `PriceSideAttribute` to dynamically evaluate required price side relative to entry price based on `ExitOrder.ExitOrderMode` (Above for `TakeProfit`, Below for `StopLoss` for Long positions; inverted for Short positions; skipped for manual/system exits).

## [0.0.11] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- `CurrencyCreate` and `CurrencyEdit` views with corresponding `CurrencyCreateVM` and `CurrencyEditVM` for modal create/edit flows in maintenance.
- `ExchangeCreate` and `ExchangeEdit` views with corresponding `ExchangeCreateVM` and `ExchangeEditVM` for modal create/edit flows in maintenance.

- Bumped all project versions to `0.0.11` (`OzzTradeDiary`, `OzzTradeDiary.WPF`, `OzzTradeDiary.SQLite`, `OzzTradeDiary.i18n`).

## [0.0.10] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- `TradingAccountEdit` view and `TradingAccountEditVM` for editing existing trading accounts via a modal dialog from `MaintenanceWindow`.
- `ReadOnlyTextBoxStyle` shared style in `Styles.xaml` — read-only `TextBox` with slightly darker background (`#EDEDED`) to visually indicate non-editable fields.
- `EditTradingAccounts_Click` handler in `MaintenanceWindow` opens `TradingAccountEdit` dialog for the selected trading account; saves and refreshes on OK.
- Edit button (pencil icon) in `MaintenanceWindow` TradingAccount toolbar, disabled when `SelectedTradingAccount` is `null` via `DataTrigger`.

### Changed

- Renamed `CreateTradingAccountVM` to `TradingAccountCreateVM` and `CreateTradingAccount` view to `TradingAccountCreate` to follow entity-first, verb-last naming convention.
- Documented naming convention: View/ViewModel names use entity-first, verb-last order (e.g., `TradingAccountCreate`, `TradingAccountCreateVM`) for Solution Explorer grouping; method names remain verb-first (e.g., `CreateTradingAccount()`, `DeleteExchange()`).

## [0.0.8] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- `DeleteExchangeCommand` bound in `MaintenanceWindow` Exchange toolbar — deletes `SelectedExchange` with `Yes/No` confirmation message box; command is disabled when no exchange is selected or when any `Symbol`/`TradingAccount` references the selected exchange (`ExchangeId`).

### Changed

- Removed `AccountCode` property from `TradingAccount` model and its generated DDL script.
- `CreateTradingAccount` dialog action buttons now use icon buttons (Bootstrap Icons) instead of plain text buttons.
- `CreateTradingAccount` dialog now displays `ExchangeCode` instead of `ExchangeId`.
- `MaintenanceWindow` TradingAccounts DataGrid now displays `Exchange.ExchangeCode` instead of `ExchangeId`.
- `SqliteDatabaseTradingAccountRepository` now supports injecting an exchange repository and maps `TradingAccount.Exchange` from database exchange records when loading trading accounts (`GetAllAsync`, `GetByIdAsync`).
- `SqliteDatabaseSymbolRepository` now supports injecting an exchange repository and maps `Symbol.Exchange` from database exchange records when loading symbols (`GetAllAsync`, `GetByTickerFullAsync`, `GetByIdAsync`).

## [0.0.6] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- `AbstractDatabaseRepository` abstract base class in `TD.SQLite` — provides `ValidateOrThrow(object model)` helper; all repositories except `SqliteDatabaseMetadataRepository` inherit from it; `ValidateOrThrow` is called in `CreateAsync` and `UpdateAsync` after the null guard and throws `ValidationException` with all DataAnnotations error messages joined by newlines.
- `CreateTradingAccount` dialog: `AddTradingAccount_Click` in `MaintenanceWindow` now opens it as a modal dialog centered on the owner window; on OK the new account is added and saved; Cancel or close discards changes.
- `CreateTradingAccountVM` live validation: per-property `ValidateProperty` calls on `Title`, `AccountCode`, `ExchangeId`, and `DisplayOrder`; `IsValid` property (`!HasErrors`) exposed for OK button `IsEnabled` binding; `ValidateModel` called in constructor so OK starts disabled.
- `ValidationTextBoxStyle` and `ValidationComboBoxStyle` shared styles in `Styles.xaml` — display inline red error text below the control, red border, and tooltip on validation failure without disabling the control.
- Validation errors displayed inline in `CreateTradingAccount` dialog for `Title`, `AccountCode`, and `Exchange` fields.
- `Title` TextBox auto-focused when `CreateTradingAccount` dialog opens via `FocusManager.FocusedElement`.
- `AbstractDiaryVM` base class in `TD.WPF.ViewModels` — consolidates repository initialization and CRUD operations (Currency, Exchange, TradingAccount, Symbol) shared across ViewModels.
- `AppVersion` static class in `TD.WPF.Models` — reads product name, version, copyright, and description from assembly attributes at runtime.
- `MaintenanceWindow` Add, Save (with auto-refresh), and Refresh CRUD operations for Currency, Exchange, TradingAccount, and Symbol entities via code-behind event handlers.
- `MainWindow` title bar now displays the application version number via `AppVersion.Version`.
- Added generated symbol seed script `OzzTradeDiary.SQLite/DbScripts/Symbols-Data.sql` and wired symbol repository initialization to seed `Symbols` via `SeedIfEmpty`.
- Added shared `ModelValidator` in `TD.Validation` for DataAnnotations-based model validation reusable across WPF, MAUI, and ASP.NET.
- Added `OzzTradeDiary.i18n` (`net10.0`) localization project with generated resource sets: `ActionStrings`, `CommonStrings`, `ErrorStrings`, `LocalizedStrings`, and `MessageStrings` (including `tr` culture variants).
- Implemented `CreateTradingAccount` window form bindings to `CreateTradingAccountVM`, including an `Exchanges` combo box (`ItemsSource=Exchanges`) with two-way selection bound to `ExchangeId`.
- Added `OK` and `Cancel` action buttons to `CreateTradingAccount` dialog.

### Changed
- Bumped all project versions to `0.0.6` (`OzzTradeDiary`, `OzzTradeDiary.WPF`, `OzzTradeDiary.SQLite`, `OzzTradeDiary.i18n`).
- `CreateTradingAccount` dialog property label `TextBlock` elements now bind to `{x:Static i18n:LocalizedStrings.PropertyName}` instead of hardcoded strings.
- Model DataAnnotations now use `TD.i18n` resources for localized display names and validation messages.
- Moved `MainWindow` into `Views/` subfolder; namespace updated to `TD.WPF.Views`.
- Moved `MaintenanceWindow` and its view-model into `Views/Maintenance/` and `ViewModels/Maintenance/` subfolders; namespaces updated to `TD.WPF.Views.Maintenance` and `TD.WPF.ViewModels.Maintenance`.
- Localization/resource generation guidance updated: resources are generated by `OzzCodeGen` via `OzzCodeGen/ResourceGen.settings` + `OzzCodeGen/Vocabulary`; `LocalizedStrings.resx`, model classes, and database schema are sourced from `OzzTradeDiary.OzzGen` generation outputs.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-03-12
### Added
- Added `IDatabaseSymbolRepository` and `SqliteDatabaseSymbolRepository` in `TD.SQLite`.
- Added `_Maintenance` menu to `MainWindow` with `ShowMaintenanceCommand` — opens `MaintenanceWindow` and brings it to front if already open.
- Added `_Help` menu to `MainWindow` with `ShowAboutCommand` that displays `AboutDialog` as a modal dialog.
- Added `AboutDialog` with product name, version, description, copyright, and GitHub hyperlink.
- `AboutDialog` auto-closes on deactivation to prevent blocking `MainWindow` when another window is focused.
- `AboutDialog` loads the highest resolution frame available from the `.ico` file.
- Added info-circle-fill icon to the About menu item.
- Added `WindowExtensions.SetIconFromGeometryResource()` extension method for rendering Bootstrap Icon geometry as a window title bar icon.
- `MaintenanceWindow` title bar icon set to `gear-wide-connected` via `SetIconFromGeometryResource()`.

### Changed
- Enforced `Symbol.TickerFull` as a unique immutable key in repository behavior (cannot be changed after insert).
- `Symbol` update flow now only updates mutable fields (`Description`, `DisplayOrder`, `IsActive`) to protect identifier/classification fields after creation.

### Technical
- Implemented repositories now include `Currency`, `Exchange`, `TradingAccount`, and `Symbol`.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-03-12
### Added
- Added application icon.

### Changed
- Renamed `TradePlan` model to `TradeImage` to better reflect its purpose as image attachments with notes for trades.

- Added missing `OrderType` column to generated DDL scripts for `EntryOrder`, `TakeProfitOrder`, and `StopLossOrder`.
- Updated project versions of `OzzTradeDiary.WPF` and `OzzTradeDiary.SQLite` to `0.0.4` for internal change tracking (`2026-03-12`).
- Updated DDL generation to use idempotent table creation (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`).

### Technical
- Data layer implementation is still in progress.
- Implemented repositories: `Currency`, `Exchange`, and `TradingAccount`. Remaining model repositories will be added.
- Model naming is singular, related table naming is plural.
- Each model has a generated DDL file in `OzzTradeDiary.SQLite/DbScripts` named `<ModelName>.sql`.
- Some models have generated seed files named `<PluralTableName>-Data.sql` in `OzzTradeDiary.SQLite/DbScripts`.
- Each CUD function updates metadata timestamp via `SaveLastUpdateUtcAsync` in `SqliteDatabaseMetadataRepository`.
- Confirmed `DbScripts` SQL files are generated via `OzzCodeGen` (not manually edited).

### Documentation
- Updated `README.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for unreleased status guidance.
- Documented SQLite model/table/script conventions and repository coverage status.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-03-08
